# UK Poisons Information Database - Backend

This is the backend application which powers the UK Poisons Information Database (UKPID), a service provided by
the [National Poisons Information Service (NPIS)](https://www.npis.org/).

The main role of NPIS is to advise NHS healthcare professionals on the diagnosis, treatment and care of poisoned
patients across the UK. The major workload of the NPIS is to advise hospital emergency departments, however minor
injuries units and primary care services are also significant users of the service â€“ the latter involving NHS advice
services (NHS 111, NHS 24 and NHS Direct) to a large extent. Telephone calls are answered by Specialists in Poisons
Information (SPIs). Data from telephone enquiries to the NPIS and the advice given are stored in UKPID.

Primary access to this backend is via
the [Electron-based frontend application](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/UKPID-Frontend).
