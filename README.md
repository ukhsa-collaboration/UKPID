# UK Poisons Information Database - Backend

[![tests status](https://gitlab.com/juicy-media-ltd/ukpid/ukpid-backend/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/juicy-media-ltd/ukpid/ukpid-backend/commits/main)

## Introduction

This is the backend application which powers the UK Poisons Information Database (UKPID), a service provided by
the [National Poisons Information Service (NPIS)](https://www.npis.org/).

The main role of NPIS is to advise NHS healthcare professionals on the diagnosis, treatment and care of poisoned
patients across the UK. The major workload of the NPIS is to advise hospital emergency departments, however minor
injuries units and primary care services are also significant users of the service â€“ the latter involving NHS advice
services (NHS 111, NHS 24 and NHS Direct) to a large extent. Telephone calls are answered by Specialists in Poisons
Information (SPIs). Data from telephone enquiries to the NPIS and the advice given are stored in UKPID.

This is a Laravel-based application supported by a MongoDB database for enquiry data and a MySQL database used for
storing application data (e.g. users, sessions, tokens).

Primary access to this backend application is via
the [Electron-based desktop application](https://gitlab.com/juicy-media-ltd/ukpid/ukpid-desktop-app).

## Development

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based local environment is provided for development.

PHP, Nginx, MySQL 8, and MongoDB containers are provided to run the core application. Additional database containers are
available for PHPUnit testing purposes.

For package management, an NPM (Node.js) container is provided, and Composer is included in the Laravel container. This
negates the need for versions of these to be maintained on the host machine.

A [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) container is provided as a SMTP host to capture and preview emails sent
from the application. It can be accessed at [http://localhost:35082](http://localhost:35082)

### Prerequisites

You must have the following setup and ready to go before working on this project:

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    * On Windows, ensure Docker is using WSL2. It is highly recommended that you clone this project inside your WSL
      environment, the performance gain of this vs running it from Windows will be vast.
    * On Mac, ensure Docker is configured to use VirtioFS as its file sharing implementation.
    * For more details on this, visit
      the [Juicy Media Wiki](https://juicy-media-ltd.gitlab.io/wiki/development/docker.html)
* [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) **2023.2 or later**
    * The `.idea` directory is intentionally committed to this repository, as it stores IDE configurations that will
      assist
      with the development of this application (e.g. Laravel Pint inspection profiles, an XDebug config, and so on).
    * [Laravel Idea](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13441-laravel-idea) is a paid extension for PhpStorm which
      provides additional IDE support for Laravel. It is highly recommended.

### Directory Structure

This repository is organised to make things a little cleaner and not too overwhelming the first time you look at it.

The root of the repo will contain _utility stuff_, mainly for aiding development. Docker files, IDE configs, CI/CD
files, documentation, etc.

The actual application is contained within the `/application` directory.

### Setup

1. Prepare the Docker environment by copying the override file for your environment when applicable:
   * **Windows only:** Copy the `/docker-compose.override-wsl.yml` file to `/docker-compose.override.yml`
        * The WSL override file in the project assumes the WSL OS that Docker is configured to use has a user set up and
          isn't using the root account. You may need to tweak your override file or not use it if you encounter file
          permission issues.
   * **Apple Silicon-based Macs only:** Copy the `/docker-compose.override-mac-apple-silicon.yml` file
       to `/docker-compose.override.yml`
2. In `/application`, copy the `.env.development` file to `.env`.
    * This should contain all the environment variables required to get started for development
3. Run `docker-compose build` in the root of the project to build the docker images
4. Run `docker-compose run npm npm install` to install node packages
5. Run `docker-compose run laravel composer install` to install php packages
6. Run `docker-compose run vite npm run build` to generate frontend assets
7. Run `docker-compose up` in the root of the project to start the docker containers
8. In a new terminal window, run `docker-compose exec laravel php artisan key:generate` to generate application encryption keys
9. Run `docker-compose exec laravel php artisan migrate --seed` to create and populate the database
10. Once that's all finished, the application should be visible at [http://localhost:35080](http://localhost:35080)

Add yourself to the authors listed in the composer.json file!

### Composer

Composer is included in the Laravel Docker image for PHP package management.

To interact with it, use `docker-compose run laravel composer <command>`.

### NPM

A Node docker container is provided for npm package management.

To interact with it, use `docker-compose run npm npm <command>`.

### Frontend assets

While this application doesn't have much of a frontend as its primary purpose is to provide an API for consumption by
the desktop app, we do need to provide a login page for OAuth purposes. As such, we need something that can bundle our
CSS and JS, such as Vite.

Vite has two commands:

* `docker-compose run --service-ports vite` to watch for changes and compile for development. _(Note: you must include
  the `--service-ports` flag to expose the required ports for this to work)_
* `docker-compose run vite npm run build` to compile for production

As with the frontend application, the minimal UI provided by the backend
utilises [Microsoft's Fluent UI web components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fluent-ui/web-components/).

For icons, use [Fluent UI System Icons](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/tree/main). Copy the icon you
need to the `public/icons` directory if you need to serve the icon file (i.e. in an `<img>`), or copy the SVG source
code to a new component in `resources/views/components/icons`. If creating a component, add the `ukpid-logo` class to
the `<svg>` element.

### Telescope

[Laravel Telescope](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/telescope) is accessible on local environments
via [/telescope](http://localhost:35080/telescope/).

### XDebug

XDebug is available for PHP debugging. A PhpStorm configuration is provided in this repo.

You will need to send a `XDEBUG_SESSION` cookie with the value `PHPSTORM` with your API requests. In the browser, this
cookie can be set with
the [Xdebug Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) extension.

To run Artisan with XDebug enabled, inside the interactive shell run: <br>
`export XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=PHPSTORM remote_connect_back=1 client_host=host.docker.internal client_port=9003"`.

## Testing

This project uses [Laravel's testing tools](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/testing) for unit and feature testing.

You must write tests to accompany the code you write and the features you implement. The majority of these tests are
likely to be feature tests to ensure the application produces the expected result for a given input. Where the code you
write can be tested in isolation, you should write a unit test.

Tests are run automatically on merge requests, commits to the `main` branch, and on deployments. Tests must pass for the
merge request to be accepted and for the deployment to start.

Testing requires a few extra docker containers, such as a testing database, and Selenium for frontend tests. To help
save resources, these are **not** set to spin up with the other containers listed in the docker compose file. When you
come to run tests on your development machine, you should run `docker-compose --profile test up` before running the
commands below.

You can use `docker-compose exec laravel php artisan test` to run the tests.

### Frontend testing

Since this application has a frontend, however minimal it may be, it also requires testing. For
this, [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/dusk) is used.

You can use `docker-compose exec laravel php artisan dusk` to run the tests. **Ensure you have built the frontend assets
for production, and are not running Vite's dev server before running Dusk.**

## Contributing

### NPM

This project is configured to install npm packages as dev dependencies by default. The reason for this being that dev
dependencies are excluded from the packaged application. These dependencies are either exclusively used for testing, or
are packages used by the renderer which are bundled up by Vite during the build process. If we were to include these
dependencies are they are then the app package grows by about 500mb. They aren't necessary and saving them as dev
dependencies by default removes the burden of having to pass the -D flag.

For packages used by node in the main process, you'll need to pass `--save-prod` to the npm install command to save
these as production dependencies which are included in the packaged app. If you encounter a module not found error when
running a packaged build the cause is probably this.

### Code quality

This project uses several tools to enforce code standards and style.

There's always debates to had over which code style is better, but they're not really important. These tools enforce one
style and strive solve the issue of conflicts between developers. You might not like it, but just go along with it!

#### Laravel Pint

[Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pint) is installed and configured to enforce an opinionated code standard
for PHP files in this project. You should ensure Pint is run before you make a commit.

PhpStorm 2023.2 introduced support for Pint, so ensure you are running an up-to-date version of the IDE before making
contributions. The PhpStorm configuration included in this repo is set up to run Pint on code format, though you may
need to ensure that the PHP Docker is selected as the configuration (Settings/Preferences > PHP > Quality Tools >
Laravel Pint > Configuration: Select `laravel`. If that isn't an option, create a new configuration and point it to the
Laravel Docker container).

You may wish to set PhpStorm to run code reformatting on save (Settings/Preferences > Tools > Actions on Save).

You can also use `docker-compose exec laravel ./vendor/bin/pint -v` to run Laravel Pint manually.

#### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is installed and configured to enforce an opinionated code standard
for JS, CSS, JSON and Markdown files in this project. You should ensure Pint is run before you make a commit.

PhpStorm is configured to run Prettier on save and on reformat. You should configure PhpStorm to use the node.js
interpreter provided by Docker for this project (Settings/Preferences > Languages > node.js > Node Interpreter: In the
dropdown, select Add > Add Remote > Docker Compose. PhpStorm should auto select the docker-compose.yml file.
Select `npm` as the service.)

You can also use `docker-compose run npm npx prettier . --write` to run Prettier manually.

#### ESLint and Stylelint

ESLint and Stylelint are also installed and configured on this project to enforce an opinionated code standard
for JS and CSS files.

PhpStorm should highlight errors in code.

You can use `docker-compose run npm npm run lint:js` to run ESLint, `docker-compose run npm npm run lint:style` to run
Stylelint, or `docker-compose run npm npm run lint` to run both along with a Prettier check.

#### Markdown Notifications

Indentation can break the Markdown formatting of notification views. You should ensure that you do not reformat these
particular blade files.

### Writing content

There'll be times when you need to write user-facing messages such as status and error messages. Follow the spirit of
the [NHS's content style](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/how-we-write) when doing this. Keep it clear and
concise. Use punctuation and a spell checker.

### Review process

No code should be committed to the main branch without being submitted and reviewed as a merge request.

Merge requests must be reviewed and approved by a lead developer. CI/CD Pipelines are configured to run Laravel tests
and code quality tests on the code being submitted for merge. These pipelines must succeed before the merge request can
be approved. To save time and reduce the usage of pipeline minutes, it is recommended you run these tools locally before
marking your MR as ready for review.

## Documentation

### API Documentation

[Scramble](https://scramble.dedoc.co) is used to generate API documentation.

You'll have two routes where you can view the documentation on your local environment:

- `/docs/api` - UI viewer for your documentation
- `/docs/api.json` - Open API document in JSON format describing your API.

Scramble will analyze the code and try and detect what type a property is, however it may not always be correct (it
doesn't appear to have support for Eloquent Accessors & Mutators, for example). You should review the documentation as
you add new resources and endpoints and ensure the type definitions are correct.

**Note:** Scramble doesn't currently support the MongoDB database driver. It will throw an error if it tries to parse
any routes which use it. For now, these routes are manually excluded from the api docs via the `AppServiceProvider`. A
proper workaround will be considered later.

### Application Documentation

While your code should be clean, obvious, and documented through docblocks and comments as appropriate, it may be
necessary to write documentation to detail processes, features, and anything else you deem relevant as you contribute to
this application. If you do this, you should write it in a Markdown file in the `/docs` directory.
